Make sure to understand the file structure before any edit.

If you're new to open source, read [this article](https://dvmhmdsd.me/blog/open-source/) to get involved.

# Here are the ways you can help
1. Improve existing features.
2. Add a new feature.
3. Test for issues and report them.
4. Help in code reviewing and provide feedback.

# Required Steps to follow to make your PR accepted and merged
1. Take care about Encapsulation rules.
2. The names of functions, variables, components and classes should be descriptive 
and be according to the Dart [Naming Conventions](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).
3. No unnecessary comments.
4. No warnings on the console or the terminal (always lint your code).

# Add a new module or component
If you see that there's a new module suitable for the application, write a proposal first that describes the following:
1. What the module is ? and what does it do ?
2. Why you think it's required ?
3. What are the requirements you want to finish this module ?
4. What is the time expected to finish it ?
5. What are the tools you will use to build it ?
6. What are the components and services you'll add ? (specify the name of the component and the function of this component).

After your proposal is accepted you can start adding the new module or the component that you wish, 
but make sure that you adhere to the project structure and if any dependency is added, also, 
make sure that you add it in the readme.md file.

# Found a critical bug
If you found a critical bug, open an issue on the issues tab and provide a detailed description about what you found.

# Frequently Asked Questions
**I found a typo, should I report an issue before I can make a pull request?**

For typos and other wording changes, you can directly open pull requests without first creating an issue. 
Issues are more for discussing larger problems associated with code or structural aspects of the curriculum.
